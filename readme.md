# Humid
Just a quick humidity / temperature display for in and outside.

Shit im using:
- d1 mini esp8266 (wifi board)
- Nextion Enhanced NX3224K028 (touch display)
- DHT22 (humidity and temp sensor)
- openweathermap api (for the outside info)

Config can be found in `code/humid/sample_config.h` but youll need to rename it
to `config.h` after editing it.
